        Purposes can be different or many such as mine. the purpose of my first purpose or goal is to support my family and make my mother proud. It is the fundamental purpose which cannot be diverted under any circumstances. Since these two purposes are mentioned, the third purpose of my life is to stay a good person and abide by the rules of Allah no matter the ups and downs of life.
